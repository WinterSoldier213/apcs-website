        <p>This project is something I coded using Python.  My goal was to have gears that rotate at different speeds to make it look realistic.  It took a lot of trial and error, but I was eventually able to perfect the movement of the gears.  I ultimately learned how to animate pictures to make them look more interesting.</p>

        <h2>Personal Project</h2>
        <p><a href="https://academy.cs.cmu.edu/course/cs0-21">Python Cmu</a></p>
        <p>This project is a lantern I coded using Python.  My goal was to use different shapes and gradients to create a picture of an illuminated lantern.  I accomplished my goal by using a bunch of different shapes and creative thinking.  I learned how to use different shapes, borders, and lines to create a picture.</p>
